# Web3 Development Resources

This is a curated list of web3 related tutorials that I personally found very helpful when starting with web3 development. In terms of background, I had many years of programming experience in Matlab, Python, Excel VBA, and SQL prior to that.

# üíéSolidity
* [Full Solidity course by Stephen Grider][Grider] - Excellent udemy course that teaches you the basics of interacting with smart contracts on Ethereum without using a framework like truffle or hardhat. This will help you to appreciate truffle/hardhat later on. Note that this tutorial uses an old version of the Solidity compiler, but I think it's still worth it as he explains the general concepts very well.
* [Eattheblocks tutorials on youtube][Eattheblocks] - Eattheblocks has many short tutorials and intros on Solidity and Web3 which I found very helpful 

# üé≠ NFT minting
* [Alchemy NFT minting tutorial][AlchemyNFT] - Great tutorial showing how to set up an NFT minting page starting from the Solidity contracts in hardhat and then implementing the Wallet Connect button and the mint functionality using React. Highly recommended! 

# üï∏Ô∏è React
* [How to build a website in React][ReactWebsite] - Great tutorial to learn how to build a website using a React (not web3 related)  
* [Task tracker][TaskTrackerReact] - Great tutorial to learn how to build an interactive task tracker in React (not web3 related)

# üé® CSS
* [Complete Course][CSSCompleteCourse] - Full course on css. Very well explained!
* [CSS Grid][CSSGrid] - Specific course on CSS Grids which is used a lot in website layout design 


# üíª Developer stack
* [Remix] - Online IDE for quick Smart Contract prototyping and testing
* [Visual Studio Code][VSCode] - IDE for web3 development (Solidity, React, etc.)
* [Hardhat] - Preferred Smart Contract development framework
* [Web3 library] - A JavaScript library to interact with Ethereum (it abstracts away the complexity of JSON RPC calls)
* [Etherjs] - Alternative to Web3
* [Mocha] - General purpose JavaScript library for testing code. Used to write unit test smart contracts
* [Chai] - Alternative to Mocha
* [Waffle] - Library for writing and testing smart contracts. Tests using Waffle are written with Mocha alongside Chai. Waffle is typically used in connection with hardhat.

# Contribution

Rather than sharing general links to webpages, my goal is to maintain a short list of helpful tutorials that cover most of the relevant topics and equip new joiners with the required skills. You can contribute as follows:
* **Adding new tutorials**: If you want to add to this list, open an issue, share the link, describe what the tutorial is about and why you like it. 
* **Editing existing list**: If you believe that there are better tutorials than the ones that I listed above, open an issue, share the link, describe what this tutorial is about and why you think it's better than the currently listed one.
